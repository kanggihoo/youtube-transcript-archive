## Transcript

**0:00** · Hi. Welcome to another video. So, today I want to talk about AI design skills.

**0:05** · If you've been building front-ends with AI agents this year, you already know the problem. The code part is basically solved. Any decent model can give you a working React app, but the design part is still where everything falls apart.

**0:17** · You ask for a website and you get the same purple gradient, the same Inter font, the same three-card feature grid with rounded corners. I call it AI slop and everyone is tired of it. Now, there's been a whole wave of design skills coming out to fix this. These are basically markdown files that teach your agent how to think about design before it writes any code. There are entire lists floating around with 45-plus design skills and a bunch of videos covering them, but I don't think you need 45 skills. I actually think installing that many is actively bad for your agent and I'll explain why.

**0:46** · Instead, what I want to do in this video is give you my actual view of how these skills fit together as a workflow. The way I see it, there are four layers to getting good design out of an AI agent: direction, system, feedback, and polish.

**0:58** · If you cover those four layers, you're done. Everything else is noise.

**1:01** · And then at the end, I'll show you what I think is the real cheat code right now, which is pairing these skills with GLM 5.3 Flash.

**1:08** · Because once the creativity is coming from the skill file, you don't need an expensive frontier model to execute it.

**1:13** · And Flash is stupidly cheap and surprisingly good at visual stuff. So, let's get right into it. First, let me explain how I think about these skills because I think most people are using them wrong. A skill file is not magic.

**1:24** · It's a system prompt with a job title.

**1:26** · The model already knows what good design looks like. It has seen every Awwwards site on the internet. The problem is that when you just say make it look nice, the model averages everything it has seen and the average of all websites is slop. A design skill stops the averaging. It forces the model to commit to one direction and stick to it. So, the skill is basically a creative director and the model is the developer executing the vision.

**1:50** · Once you see it that way, the whole workflow becomes obvious. You need one skill for direction, one file for your design system, one loop for visual feedback, and one pass for polish. Four layers. Let's go through them. Layer one is direction, and for this, the one I'd start with is Anthropic's own front-end design skill. This is the official one that ships as a plug-in for Claude Code, and honestly, it's one of the best-written skill files I've seen. It's not a list of rules, it's a design philosophy. It explicitly tells the model to avoid generic AI slop aesthetics.

**2:19** · It forces the model to pick a bold aesthetic lane before writing any code. Brutalist, editorial, maximalist, luxury, whatever, but it has to pick one and commit. It literally bans the overused fonts.

**2:31** · Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesque, all banned.

**2:35** · It demands CSS variables for consistency, unexpected layouts, and real attention to motion. Like one well-orchestrated page load animation, instead of random fade-ins everywhere.

**2:46** · To get it, you can just install the front-end design plug-in from the official marketplace inside Claude Code.

**2:52** · Or, since it's all just markdown, you can grab the skill.md file from the Anthropic's Claude Code repo on GitHub, and copy it into your .claudskills folder. And because it's plain markdown, it works with basically any agent. Open Code, Verdin, Codex, whatever you're running, you just feed it in as context.

**3:11** · Remember this point, because it's exactly why the GLM section later works.

**3:15** · The difference this one file makes is honestly ridiculous. Same model, same prompt, and instead of the Bootstrap-looking template, you get editorial typography, a proper palette, grain textures, staggered entry animations. It looks like something a human charged money for. Now, layer two is the system layer, and this is the one most people skip. The direction skill gives you taste, but it doesn't give you consistency.

**3:36** · If you generate five pages across five prompts, you'll get five slightly different sites.

**3:41** · The fix for that is a design.md file, which is basically a design system written in plain markdown that lives in your project root. Colors, typography rules, spacing, component styling, guardrails, all spelled out in a format the agent can actually read.

**3:57** · And the easiest way to get started with this is a repo called awesome design MD by Volt Agent. I've covered it before, and that video will be linked below.

**4:05** · It's a curated collection of over 50 design.md files inspired by real sites: Vercel, Linear, Stripe, Raycast, Superbase, and so on.

**4:14** · Each one comes with preview HTML files, so you can actually see the direction before you commit to it. You pick one, copy it into your project root, and tell your agent to treat it as the visual source of truth. And to be clear, I wouldn't use these to make lazy clones.

**4:28** · Borrow the discipline, then adapt it to your own brand. One distinction that really matters here: agents.md is for how the project should be built.

**4:37** · Design.md is for how it should look and feel. Keep those separate.

**4:41** · A lot of AI design drift comes from people cramming architecture, behavior, and styling into one giant prompt, and the model just loses the thread.

**4:49** · If you want to go further on this layer, there's also Theme Factory, which generates reusable design tokens and CSS variables from a single source, so the model stops inventing a new shade of gray for every component.

**5:00** · And there's Impeccable by Paul Backhouse, which is a really clever one.

**5:04** · It has separate brand and product modes because a landing page and a dashboard need opposite design principles, and it gives you little commands like typeset and colorize and quieter to nudge the design around without rewriting everything.

**5:16** · You can install it by running NPX skills at P Backhouse {slash} impeccable. That one is kind of underrated. Now, layer three, and this is the one I think is the most important of all four. Feedback. Here's the thing: your agent is designing blind. It writes CSS, but it never sees the rendered page. That's why AI designs drift and break. The fix is giving the agent eyes, and the way you do that is with a browser skill, the web app testing skill, or just a Playwright setup where the agent opens its own work in a headless browser, screenshots every page, looks at the the and grades its own output against the design file.

**5:47** · This turns design from a one-shot gamble into a loop. Generate, screenshot, compare, fix, repeat. And the agent will genuinely catch its own mistakes this way.

**5:57** · Overflowing text, broken mobile layouts, contrast issues, spacing that looked fine in code, but terrible on screen. If you take just one thing from this video, make it this layer. A design skill without a screenshot loop is a creative director who never looks at the work.

**6:11** · And then layer four is polish. Two things here, motion and accessibility.

**6:15** · For motion, there's a GSAP skill that handles proper animation work, scroll triggers, timeline sequencing, that kind of stuff.

**6:24** · Instead of the model hand-rolling janky keyframes.

**6:27** · And for accessibility, there's access lint, which checks your color contrast against WCAG thresholds, and reviews your semantic HTML.

**6:35** · This matters more than people think, because bold aesthetic directions love low contrast text.

**6:40** · And this skill catches it before your users do. So, that's the stack.

**6:44** · Direction, system, feedback, polish.

**6:47** · Four layers, maybe five skills total.

**6:50** · And this is where I want to push back on this skill hoarding trend a bit. There are collections out there with 63 design skills across eight plugins and lists of 45 skills that kill AI slop, and so on.

**7:02** · Look, some of those are good. UI UX Pro Max, for example, does this whole multi-step thing where it searches design databases, generates palettes, and pairs fonts per industry, and it's genuinely impressive. But every skill you install eats context, and every skill description competes for the model's attention.

**7:18** · Install 40 skills, and your agent spends half its brain deciding which one to use. Pick three or four that cover the layers, and skip the rest. More skills is not more taste.

**7:28** · \[music\] Anyway, now let's come to the part that I'm honestly most excited about, which is GLM 5.3 flash.

**7:35** · If you watch my previous videos, you know the story. This is the model that ran as the Aux Alpha stealth model, and ZAI has now confirmed it, and released the full weights on Hugging Face under an MIT license. It's a mixture of experts model with 320 billion total parameters, but only 18 billion active per token. It has a 1 million token context window. It's natively multimodal, and the API pricing is 15 cents per million input tokens, and 50 cents per million output tokens with cached input at just 3 cents. That is absurdly cheap. Now, when I ran it through my King Bench, a pattern showed up.

**8:06** · The pure logic stuff was hit or miss, but the visual stuff was consistently strong. The SVG generation was clean. The 3 JS scenes were among the best on my chart, and the UI layouts it produced were genuinely solid. This model has a natural talent for the visual layer.

**8:23** · And here's why that matters for this video. Remember what I said earlier?

**8:26** · Once the skill file is providing the design thinking, the model doesn't need to invent the creativity.

**8:31** · It just needs to execute the instructions quickly and correctly. So, you don't need Opus-level intelligence for your front end anymore. You need a fast, cheap model that follows instructions well, and understands visual structure, which is exactly what GLM 5.3 Flash is. So, the workflow I've been running looks like this. I have Claude Code pointed at the GLM API, which you can do with our coding plan, or just by swapping the base URL and API key. The same setup works in Open Code or Verdant, if that's what you use.

**8:58** · I have the front end design skill installed, a design.md in the project root, and the screenshot loop set up. Then I just prompt it, build a landing page for a developer tool. Use the front end design skill for the aesthetic direction, and the design.md as the source of truth. Then screenshot the result, and fix anything that doesn't match.

**9:20** · And because Flash is so fast and so cheap, the loop that would feel expensive on a Frontier model just doesn't matter. It generates screenshots, critiques itself, and regenerates, and the whole cycle costs you a fraction of a cent. I can generate five completely different aesthetic directions for the the page in the time a big model takes to produce one and then just pick the best.

**9:39** · That kind of iteration is where good design actually comes from and it's only viable when the per run cost is basically zero. The results are honestly kind of ridiculous for the price.

**9:49** · Editorial layouts, proper motion, consistent tokens across pages. It looks like work that came out of a model 20 times the price. Now, to be real with you, there are limits. Flash is a designer, not a systems architect. When I pushed it into complex state management and gnarly back-end logic, it wobbled. So, my recommendation is to split the work. Let Flash with the design skills handle the entire visual layer, the components, the CSS, the animations, and then switch to GLM 5.3 proper or another bigger model when it's time to wire up auth and data.

**10:20** · You use the cheap model for the heavy lifting and the expensive model only for the brain-melting logic. Your wallet will thank you. So, here's my overall verdict. Design skills are the biggest visual quality jump you can get for $0, but only if you treat them as a workflow instead of a collection. Direction from the front-end design skill, consistency from a design.md, a screenshot feedback loop so the agent can see its own work, and an accessibility pass at the end.

**10:46** · Then, run the whole thing on GLM 5.3 Flash and you've got a front-end pipeline that produces genuinely beautiful output for pennies. The links to everything will be in the description. Overall, it's pretty cool. Please share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. I'll see you in the next video. Until then, bye.
